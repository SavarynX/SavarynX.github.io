	<p class="p">In our world the power and the money is concentrated

		in the 0.1% of the population, and this has to change.<br><br>
		<br>
		The Matrix is the perfect word to describe the current world,
		which is controlled by the powerful entities behind it.
		<br>
		Everything you see or hear is manipulated by the matrix
		to keep you away from what&#39;s actually happening.<br><br>
		<br>
		The Matrix makes you believe in things it wants you to believe in,
		so you&#39;ll do things that it wants you to do.
		<br>
		As the victims, no matter how hard you try,
		you still suffer, stay poor, and be semi-depressed.

	<h2 class="matrix">Andrew Tate's Message</h2>
	<br><br>
	“I have been a sad man and a stupid slave,but I found the way out."
	<br>
	"<strong>The Matrix</strong> is now cracked,
	there is a proven way to get what you truly wantin life.
	<br>
	Don&#39;t be arrogant and think that you can do it yourself.
	<br>
	Look at you in the mirror, are you really fine?
	<br>
	If the answer is no, well, it&#39;s actually GOOD.
	<br>
	You realized it, while thousands of “superheroes” have not.
	<br>
	The clock is ticking my friends, and it&#39;s not going to stop.
	<br>

	So, stop being lazy, arrogant, and procrastinating

	like the losers around you
	that are completely controlled by the matrix
	<br>
	and its manipulative information.
	<br>
	Let&#39;s join me, become the TOP G, and get out of the matrix today!”
